Pypenador
=========

Pypenador is a command line utility for recovering and manipulating files from raw bytes
i.e. when a file has accidentally been deleted or even when the drive 
has been reformatted, or when you are lacking the credentials to access
the file of interest (for example if you forget the password to
an old computer, significant other is acting sus, etc.).
